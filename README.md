Travel photo journal that generates your entries automatically (LHL Midterm Project)

![Launch Screen](wayfarer1.png) ![Entries](wayfarer2.gif) ![Create Entry](wayfarer3.gif)

The app lets you generate photo diaries entries with minimal effort, using vacation photos that you would be taking anyways. It generates photo entries automatically for that day using the photos you took and their geotags.

- Automatically generates photo diary entries using the Photos Framework (fetching and sorting PHAssets, retrieving images and metadata) and CLLocation/CLGeocoder
- Can swap out photos and edit captions if you to change the ones automatically generated by the app
- Displays list of previous entries, can delete entries, saved/stored locally on device using Realm
- Can detail view individual entries

Demoed on Feb. 12, 2016



Stretch goals/features I hope to add at a future date:
- View entry locations on a world map
- Social media/blogging sharing 
- Edit already saved entries
